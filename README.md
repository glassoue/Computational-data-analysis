Project 1 in a group of 3:

The data provided contained transcripts of parliamentary speeches from the sittings in the Chamber of the Danish. Our group was composed by international students, therefore the case consisted of doing an exploratory analysis of parts of the data to understand the main topics from each speech over the years and model them by words that described most of the topics. This modelling was done by methods of Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as NMF and LDA. 

Project 2 in a group of 2: 

Regression problem solved using elastic-net, adaboostregressor built with decision trees and support vector regression (SVR).
